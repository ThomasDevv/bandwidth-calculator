# bandwidth-calculator
Calculates bandwidth usage on a TCP socket connection.

# How does this script work?
This script works by attempting to establish a TCP connection between the client and the server, sending specified data over the socket and calculating the amount of bytes sent and received. It then logs that amount in an external file, hence informing you of your bandwidth usage.
